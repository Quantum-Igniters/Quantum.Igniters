										<p>We are the Quantum Igniters, a First Tech Challenge (FTC) rookie team that has also participated in First Lego League (FLL) for the last 4 seasons under our FLL team; Blazing Comets. We started our FTC team this year under the name Quantum Igniters. We are a diverse group of 9 freshmen, and one 8th grader. We are a group of young minds in the field of STEM and Robotics, where each person brings unique ideas and skills into the team. Guided by our coaches and mentors, we build, program, and compete with our robots throughout various competitions and challenges. </p>

										<h2 class="major"> What is FTC? </h2>
										<p>First Tech Challenge (FTC) is a robotics program for middle and high school students (grades 7-12) run by FIRST Inspires. Students compete in teams of up to 15 to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge.
											These are some key points about FTC:
											STEM Skills: Students develop science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) skills through designing, building, and programming robots.
											Competition: Teams compete in a game that changes every year, with the playing field and objectives presented as a new challenge.
											Teamwork: Collaboration is essential for FTC success. Students work together to design, build, program, fundraise, and promote their team.
											Mentorship: Adult coaches and mentors guide students throughout the program.
											FTC is more than just about winning the competition. Itâ€™s about students developing important skills and forming a team around a shared interest in science and technology.
